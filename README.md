# LeetCode Solutions 🧩

Welcome to my LeetCode repository! Here, I upload my solutions to various LeetCode problems. This repository is my personal journey to sharpen my coding skills and deepen my understanding of algorithms and data structures.

---

## 📂 Repository Structure
The repository is organized based on the LeetCode problem numbers and names:

- `001_two_sum.js`
- `002_add_two_numbers.php`
- `003_longest_substring_without_repeating_characters.sql`
(... and so on)

Each file is named after the LeetCode problem's number and a brief description for easier reference.
